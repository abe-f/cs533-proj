Reducing the cache capacity to <512MB doesn't really make sense, as there is 512MiB of L2 in the system, and (I believe?) ZSim models an inclusive LLC.

Plan is to run a sweep from .75GiB to 2GiB LLC size (by varying the number of ways)

1. Just increase the number of ways by 10%, which is the best case scenario (but realistic for single-threaded applications).
2. Collect statistics about (1) the number of sharers for all cache lines, and (2) number of sets in the cache that have all cache lines with 0 or 1 sharers
